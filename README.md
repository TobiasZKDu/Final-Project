# Final-Project
Topic: COVID-19 Infectious and impact on the built environment

Research Question: How does COVID-19 impact the cityâ€™s-built environments and what can we learn from this correlation

We plan on using QGIS to create a map to demonstrate the infectious rate of COVID-19 we plan on using the counties data or zip code data to show the impact on different neighborhood. Additionally, we plan on using GEE to create a map showing the impact of COVID by creating a layer about the night time city light image which will be similar to the layer of Singapore from assignment 3. Finally, we plan on plotting some survey data and complaint data with jupyterlab and compare them with the areas with the most infectious cases and find the possible correlation.
